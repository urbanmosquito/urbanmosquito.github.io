While each urban system presents its own challenges, the processes of globalisation, mobility, and climate change make mosquito-borne disease a problem that transcends regional and national borders. Therefore it is important to bring together those working in and across different geographical and socio-ecological contexts to cross-fertilize ideas and insights.</p><p>This conference will bring together scholars, practitioners, and policy-makers to share and exchange their experiences and findings related to mosquitoes and mosquito-borne disease connected to the natural, built and social features of urban environments. We hope to stimulate new thinking that can help in the planning, designing, and intervening in urban environments to help prevent the spread of mosquito-borne disease, especially in the context of anthropogenic climate change.</p></p></div><div class=col-lg-4><img class=img-fluid src=images/embornal.png></div></div><div class=row><div class=col-lg-12><hr><br></div></div><div class=row><div class=col-lg-4><img class=img-fluid src=images/mosquito_upf.png></div><div class=col-lg-8><h4 style=color:#000>Keynotes</h4><p><p>Featured talks by Drs. Shannon L. LaDeau and Carsten Wergin will be held on 23 and 24 March at 13:30 in the <a href=https://www.upf.edu/es/web/campus/merce-rodoreda>Mercè Rodoreda</a> Auditorium.</p><p><strong>23 March: <a href=https://www.caryinstitute.org/science/our-scientists/dr-shannon-l-ladeau>Dr. Shannon L. LaDeau, Cary Institute</a>, &lsquo;Legacies of segregation influence mosquito ecology and human exposure in temperate cities&rsquo;</strong></p><blockquote><p>Vector-borne disease (VBD) is a growing risk in cities across the globe. Rising incidence of arboviral disease among urban residents of temperate cities highlights critical gaps in understanding of the ecological and social interactions that influence VBD transmission in these complex, seasonal landscapes. This talk describes efforts by a multidisciplinary research team to uncover mechanisms of changing mosquito-human exposure in Baltimore City, MD (USA). Our results demonstrate persistent legacies of racialized investment that have generated stark differences in mosquito habitat and biting behaviors at neighborhood scales, perpetuating environmental burdens in impoverished communities. We further evaluate how socially-derived conditions affect mosquito traits that are important to fitness and viral transmission. Finally, this talk explores how ongoing changes in climate and urban greening efforts refine the heterogeneous riskscape of VBD across urban communities in temperate regions.</p></blockquote><p><strong>24 March: <a href=https://www.asia-europe.uni-heidelberg.de/de/personen/academic-staff/wissenschaftler-personendetails/persdetail/wergin.html>Dr. Carsten Wergin, Universität Heidelberg</a>, &lsquo;Live and Let Die in the Anthropocene: Multispecies Conviviality and the Challenge of Interdisciplinary Engagement&rsquo;</strong></p><blockquote><p>Global awareness for environmental degradation and species extinction is often highlighted through images of colorful endangered birds, cute reptiles, or polar bears sadly drifting away on tiny ice floes. Meanwhile, mosquitoes with the potential to transmit arboviral diseases are what Deborah Bird Rose and Thom van Dooren (2011) have called the “unloved others”. They leave no space for romanticism. Far from being extinct, agency rests instead with the mosquito as it makes creative use of humans and their infrastructures to expand their habitat. The lecture presents social sciences and humanities approaches through which to engage with mosquito mobility in relation to climate change and global health, drawing on theories and methods from Environmental Anthropology and Experimental Ethnography.</p></blockquote></p></div></div><div class=row><div class=col-lg-12><hr><br></div></div><div class=row><div class=col-lg-8><h3 style=color:#000>Details</h3><p><p>The event will be held at Universitat Pompeu Fabra&rsquo;s Ciutadella Campus, Merce Rodoreda Building, from 23-25 March 2023, and will incliude scholars, experts and practitioners from across disciplines, delivering oral presentations as well as posters. The call for papers/abstracts is now closed and all presenters have been notified. Registration is open to the public and we will have a form up soon for this. There is no registration fee.
